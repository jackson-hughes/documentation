# Documentation

This repository houses the source code for my personal documentation. 

The built docs are hosted on Github-Pages [here](https://https://jhughes01.github.io/ "My Gitlab Pages url").

I use Python's [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/ "MkDocs Homepage") module for writing and building my documentation.
